The first official single off the album is titled "Suave Y Sutil" and was released on 7 September 2018. The song features a return to her pop sound being a departure from the reggaeton oriented singles that preceded. The single was produced by Andrés Torres and Mauricio Rengifo responsible for productions of Latin hits like "Despacito" and "Echame La Culpa" from Luis Fonsi.</p><p>In 2018, Rubio appeared in a PETA video reminding people not to leave animals or children in parked cars.</p><p>In December 2016, she confirmed that the new album will feature contributions by DJ Snake and Selena Gomez, stating: "My new album is like another member of the team, or the family. It will be a true warrior, has something from all genres, from banda to pop, collaborations with DJ Snake and Selena Gomez. I tried to keep a key element: that the music is danceable". Gomez representatives later denied that she worked with Rubio.</p><p>In 2013, Rubio began dating Mexican singer Gerardo Bazúa, a former contestant from her team on La Voz... México. In early 2015, reports confirmed that Rubio had broken up with Bazúa because she found out he was cheating on her, although on 5 March 2016, Rubio gave birth to their second son in Miami at Mercy Hospital.</p><p>Rubio first teased a new single on Valentine's Day in 2014, playing a "La Bomba"-esque song "Cuanto Te Quiero" with producers in the studio. Even though she performed it live several times, the song's release as the album lead single was cancelled. In February 2015, Rubio's single "Mi Nuevo Vicio" featuring Colombian group Morat was released. It reached number one in Spain, and number 16 in Mexico. It additionally attained a 2x Platinum certification in Spain for sales of 80,000 copies.</p><p>Rubio participated as a coach on the second season of La Voz... México along with <a href=#>Jenni Rivera</a>, Miguel Bosè and <a href=#>Beto Cuevas</a>. The second season premiered in Mexico on 9 September 2012. Rubio was also one of the three coaches for La Voz Kids, the singing competition for kids from seven to fourteen years old on Telemundo. Although she was initially slated to return for the series' second season in 2014, on 23 December 2013, Telemundo announced that Rubio would be replaced by singer Natalia Jiménez. In January 2014, Rubio then sued Telemundo for alleged breach of contract. In May 2013, it was confirmed that Rubio would become a new judge replacing Britney Spears for season three of the American version of The X Factor alongside Simon Cowell, Demi Lovato and fellow new judge Kelly Rowland (who replaced LA Reid). In December 2014, Rubio guest starred as herself on The CW series, Jane the Virgin.</p><p>In March 2012, Rubio's husband told Hola! that he and the singer were separating after nearly five years of marriage.
