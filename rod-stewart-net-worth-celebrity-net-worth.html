During his career to date, Rod Stewart has sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. That makes him one of the best-selling musicians in world history.</p><p>After being drawn to folk and R&B as a young musical artist, Rod Stewart was eventually "discovered" while playing harmonica on a London train platform by Long John Baldry. This led to a gig with the Hoochie Coochie Men, and his eventual signing to the Decca Records label in 1964. After bouncing around from group to group throughout the late 60s, he was invited to join the <a href=# title="Jeff Beck Net Worth">Jeff Beck</a> Group as a vocalist. The Jeff Beck Group was a success with their blues and funk-influenced early heavy metal sound, and they toured successfully for a few years.</p><p>Parallel to his group engagements, he pursued a solo career, releasing his debut solo album "An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down" in 1969. It was the beginning of a series of albums that would solidify his reputation as a leading figure in music.</p><p>The 1970s proved pivotal for Stewart. Hits like "Maggie May" from the album "Every Picture Tells a Story" became anthems of the era. He skillfully combined rock with a touch of folk and soul, creating a unique sound that resonated with a broad audience.</p><p>As he transitioned into the 1980s and 1990s, Stewart continued to evolve, delving into new wave and pop. His song "Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?" is a testament to his adaptability, capturing the disco-infused spirit of the time.</p><p>In the 2000s, Rod took an unexpected turn, releasing the "Great American Songbook" series, where he interpreted classic songs from the early 20th century. These albums showcased his versatility as an artist and introduced classics to a new generation of listeners.</p><p>Throughout his career, Stewart has been recognized with numerous awards, including two inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame – once as a solo artist and once as a member of Faces.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-352400 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Rod-Stewart.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-352400 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=early-life><b>Early Life</b></h2><p>Roderick David "Rod" Stewart was born in London, England on January 10, 1945. Son of Robert Joseph Stewart and Elsie Rebecca Gilbart, he is of British and Scottish descent and the youngest of five children. His childhood was preoccupied mainly with hobbies like building model railways and playing soccer. He was the captain of the school soccer team and played for Middlesex Schoolboys. Stewart did not begin to take an interest in music until well into the early 1960s, when he started to learn the harmonica, and later piano. His early influences include singer Al Jolson and <a href=# title="Little Richard Net Worth">Little Richard</a>. Stewart left school at age 15 with the ambition of becoming a professional soccer player. He joined the workforce with odd jobs including a brief gig as a gravedigger at Highgate Cemetary.</p><h2 id=early-career><b>Early Career</b></h2><p>Stewart began to busk around Leicester Square with folk singer Wizz Jones in 1962, playing the harmonica.&nbsp; For the next year and a half, they took their act on the road, traveling to places like Brighton, Paris, and Barcelona. Gaining a strong interest and liking for American rhythm and blues acts like <a href=# title="Sam Cooke Net Worth">Sam Cooke</a> and <a href=# title="Otis Redding Net Worth">Otis Redding</a>, he got his first professional job as a musician when he joined an R&B group in London called The Dimensions in October 1963 as a harmonica player and vocalist. Over the next few years, he was part of several different musical acts. He joined Jeff Beck Group in 1966, and experienced his first bit of success, releasing two albums with the band and touring the UK and the U.S. Both albums made it to #15 on the U.S. charts. At this time, he was becoming known for his nickname "Rod The Mod" due to his punk-rock alternative style and look.</p><h2 id=solo-career-beginnings-faces><b>Solo Career Beginnings and the Faces</b></h2><p>Stewart joined the band that would be known as Faces as their lead singer in October 1969. Other members included Ron Wood, Ronnie Lane, <a href=# title="Ian McLagan Net Worth">Ian McLagan</a>, and <a href=# title="Kenney Jones Net Worth">Kenney Jones</a>. Simultaneously, Stewart was signed as a solo artist by Mercury records and began making music independently as well. An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down was Stewart's first solo album, released in 1969. Faces released their first album, First Step, in early 1970. They were heavily influenced by the Rolling Stones, and the album did well in the UK and quickly earned them a strong live following. Gasoline Alley, Stewart's sophomore album, was released in Autumn 1970. Faces launched a U.S. tour that year.</p><p>Stewart was catapulted into stardom with his 1971 solo album Every Picture Tells a Story, which contained instant radio-friendly and much-beloved hits like "Reason to Believe" and "Maggie May." The album and singles held the number one spot in both the U.S. and the UK simultaneously. "Maggie May" was part of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, along with two of Stewart's other hits.</p><p>Meanwhile, Faces released a second album which saw moderately more success than the first one, and the band toured extensively in 1972. There was growing tension over Stewart's success as a solo artist. Stewart's second album was also well-received and reached No. 2 on the U.S. charts and No 1. In the UK.</p><p>Ooh La La, The Faces' final album, reached No. 1 in the UK in 1973. Notably, Rod Stewart did not even contribute the vocals for the album's most famous track of the same title. The tension between the band members and Stewart had deepened, and the band parted ways in 1975.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-293826 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Rod-Stewart-1.jpg alt="Rod Stewart Net Worth" width=900 height=636 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-293826 class=wp-caption-text>Lars Baron/Bongarts/Getty Images</p><h2 id=career-post-faces><b>Career post-Faces</b></h2><p>Stewart moved to Los Angeles in 1975, and continued to enjoy success, topping the U.S. charts yet again in 1976 for eight weeks with the ballad "Tonight's the Night." 1978's smash hit single "Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?" scored him another No. 1 spot in both the U.S. and UK. The eighties saw Rod's career slow down somewhat. 1981's Tonight I'm Yours went platinum, but albums released after that didn't fare as well.

Rachel reportedly initially sought half of his net worth as a divorce settlement. That would have been $50 – $75 million.</p><p>In the end the two settled on undisclosed terms with Rod providing funds for Rachel to purchase several homes, plus a large settlement likely in the tens of millions of dollars and an agreement to provide financial support to their two children.
